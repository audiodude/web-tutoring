For this exercise, we're going to continue to explore styling elements by their
ids and class names.

You have been provided with a full HTML document. All it is missing is the
style declarations. Copy the contents of that file to a new file somewhere in
your web root. Then add the following style declarations:

1. Make the header class have a `font-weight` of `bolder` and set the
	 `font-family` to `Arial`.
2. Set the `padding` of the div with id `top` to `20px`.
3. Make the `page-top` class have a `margin-top` value of `20px`.
4. Set the `font-size` of the `regular` class to `12px`, and set its
	 `font-family` to `Arial`.
5. Set the `background-color` of the `post-body` class to `#ddd` (a light grey).
6. Set the `margin` of the `post` class to `10px 0`.
7. Make the `post-title` class have `font-size` of `18px`.
8. Give a `font-style` of `italic` to the `bottom` class.
9. Give the `post-additional` class a `border` of `2px solid #000` and a `width`
	 of `400px`.
10. Give the image with id `sloan-pic` a `max-width` of `300px` and set its
		`float` value to `right`.
