This week we learned about how to label HTML elements with "id" and "class" attributes
in order to refer to them in CSS.

For this assignment, create a new HTML document somewhere in your main directory, maybe
a "classes" folder with an "index.html" file underneath it.

In the index.html file, create the basic structure of an HTML document, with a head,
title and body.

Underneath the head element, create a <style> element (including the </style> tag).

In the body of the document use the following basic HTML structure:

<div>
 <div>The very first div of the first section</div>
 <div>Another div in the first section</div>
</div>
<div>
  <p>A <span>paragraph</span> in the second section</div>
  <div>A div in the second section</div>
</div>

Now give the div on line 14 of this document the id "top".

Give the div on line 18 (the second top level div) the id "bottom".

Give the first div in the first section and the first (and only) paragraph in the
second div the class "first".

Give the second div in the first section the class "alternate".

Give the div in the second section the classes "alternate" and "low-priority".

Give the span the class "heavy".


Finally, you should add some styles for your ids and classes. Remember, these go into
the <style> block in your <head> section.

Assign a background-color to "top", "alternate" and "low-priority".

Assign a different font-size for "top".

Assign a different font-size to all paragraphs on the page.

Assign a text color for "alternate".

Make the element with class "heavy" have a font-weight of bold.


Be sure to run your HTTP server and preview your changes often. It will likely be easier
to debug as you go than all at the end.
