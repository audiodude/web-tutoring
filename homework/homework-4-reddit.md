For this week, try to replicate http://web.archive.org/web/20080227165747/http://reddit.com/?

This is the reddit homepage from 2008. It's a bit more straightforward than the current one.
The idea is to decompose the page into a series of nested boxes, with margins and paddings and borders
(box model).

Some of the boxes need to be floated to the left or right so that other content flows around them.

Remember that to reference an img, you can get the URL of the image and then use:

&lt;img src="http://somewebsite.com/some/image.jpg"&gt;

Good luck!
